### Effective_DataVisualization_using_PlotlyExpress
In order to take my Data_Visualization skills to the next level, i have done a Udemy course under the title of "Learn Effective_Data_Visulaization_Using_Plotly".
In this course, i have learnt how to create the following chart types using Plotly and Plotly express:
* Scatterplots.
* Lineplots.
* Areaplots.
* Histogram.
* Boxplots.
* Violinplots.
* Pie charts.
* Sunburst.
* Treemaps.
* Choropleth maps.


Here are the list of the datasets that have been used in this course:
* All stocks 5 year price.
* Apple stock price 5 years.
* Auto MPG Dataset.
* Gapminder dataset.
* Iris flower dataset.
* Share of individuals using the internet dataset.
* Tips dataset.
* World Happiness ranking 2019.


**Important Note:** Since Plotly and Plotly express use interactive visualization, in order to see the plots one has to open the files using Google Colab!
